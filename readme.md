## Overview

[pulumi-deploy-and-document-challenge](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-pulumi-deploy-and-document-challenge-3000-in-prizes-887?bb=219434)

This repo has 2 repos:

1. HTML (Static) app deployment to AWS s3

2. ReactJS app deplyoment to AWS s3

### Features
- Deploy a static HTML app and ReactJS app to **AWS S3**.
- Use **Pulumi** to automate the deployment process.
- Make the S3 bucket publicly accessible for website hosting.
- Set custom S3 bucket policies.
- Load configuration through environment variables (`.env` file).

### Purpose

This project demonstrates the ease of deploying a static website using infrastructure as code (IAC) principles. Pulumi allows us to write code to define and deploy cloud infrastructure, making it a powerful tool for developers who prefer a more code-centric approach compared to traditional CLI-based tools like Terraform or CloudFormation.

## Tech Stack

- **Pulumi**: Infrastructure as Code (IAC) tool.
- **AWS S3**: Cloud storage service to host the static website.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used to run Pulumi scripts.
- **AWS SDK**: To interact with AWS resources.
- **dotenv**: Manage environment variables locally.
